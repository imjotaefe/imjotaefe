## Hi, I'm JoÃ£o Fernando ðŸš€

I spent the last 5 years developing differente kind of projects. I have worked with big and small teams, big and small projects. So I have some experience on hand in products, independent of the variables. I developed mobile apps, landing pages, web systems, backends and some games. And because of that, I have experience since from the idea of a project until to build and upload that on a store.
